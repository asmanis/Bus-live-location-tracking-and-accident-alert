# Bus live location tracking and accident alert

Cyber-Physical System
This project presents a prototype Cyber-Physical System based on the Arduino Uno R4 WiFi platform.
The system integrates a GPS module (Neo-6M) for real-time school bus location tracking, an MPU6050 accelerometer
for motion and accident detection,a flame sensor for detecting fire in the bus and an I2C LCD for accident alerts.
Sensor data are processed in real time and transmitted via a built-in WiFi web server, allowing
remote visualization of the system’s location on a Google Maps interface.
The system is experimental for educational and academic purposes only.
